<h2>HideURL Notes</h2>
<p>HideURL is a simple HTML website that embeds pages to mask them.</p>
<p>Not all sites accept the style of embedding that this site uses, so some might not work.</p>
<p>Securly can still block the embedded sites, but on about:blank mode, it can not see the screen.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: I am NOT RESPONSIBLE if you get in trouble for using this site.</p>
